1.  It is safe to eagerly define the variable bound to a function's name, because functions in Lox have dynamic scope, whereas other variables in Lox have lexical scope.
2.  In Java, the code does not compile, because both instances of the variable name refer to the local variable, and the Java disallows compilation when a local variable is used before it is declared. Similarly, in Python, an UnboundLocalError is thrown, because the variable assigning to refers to the local variable of the same name, which is unbound when the assignment happens. I agree with their choices, because it seems unlikely to want to create a shadowed variable with the same value as the variable that it is shadowing (and there are workarounds to make this work if truly necessary, such as assigning to another local variable).
4.  Challenge problem skipped.
