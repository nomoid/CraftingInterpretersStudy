1. One valid type to support comparisons would be strings, using Lexicographic order (for example, `"abc"` comes before `"abd"` because `"c"` comes before `"c"`). I would not extend Lox to support less-than or greater-than comparisons between mixed types, because I don't think there is a well-defined and useful way to perform the comparison.
In other languages, Java does not support comparison between non-primitive types, opting to use the `compareTo` function instead, whereas Python supports comparison between strings, using lexicographical ordering.
3. Right now, if we divide by zero, we get the result `infinity`. This is due to Java `doubles` resulting in `infinity` when dividing by zero, and that the only numerical type in this langauge is `double`. Many other languages handle division differently for `ints` and `floats`: for `ints`, division by zero results in an error, whereas for `floats`, division by zero results in `infinity`. Since there is no `int` in this language, `doubles` will be used where `ints` are normally used in other langauges, so it makes sense to report a runtime error for dividing by zero.
